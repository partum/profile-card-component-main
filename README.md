## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
<p style="font-size: 12px">London</p>
```

I wanted to add a small style rule to one component, so instead of figuring out what selector should be use specificaly I just used inline CSS.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

This snippet is important to center items both horizontaly and verticaly.

### Continued development

I think the most obvious improvement I need to make is with positioning background images. I know they look off, but I don't know how to make them perfect. I also don't know how to position them so they look right in the mobile view. Now that I type this I realize the answer is media quires.  
The other thing I want to improve is my positioning skills. I think my work /looks/ right but I'm not sure I went about it in the right way.
